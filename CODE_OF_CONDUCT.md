# Code of Conduct

## Community Guidelines

This project adheres to community standards inspired by the NIPY code of conduct, which itself draws from the Python community, Apache Foundation, Debian, and Burning Man principles.

## Core Values

Community members should embody these qualities:

**Open**: Accept all who wish to participate; foster collaboration on data reuse, methods, and best practices.

**Collaborative**: Explain work to others, provide constructive criticism, and accept feedback graciously.

**Inquisitive**: Encourage questions; those asked should respond helpfully toward shared goals.

**Considerate**: Be thoughtful about others' efforts; communicate tactfully in person and online.

**Careful in words**: Avoid personal insults, violent threats, discriminatory language, sexual/violent material, private content sharing, excessive profanity, harassment, and advocacy of these behaviors.

**Concise**: Write briefly and empathetically; add unique contributions; stay on-topic.

**Respectful**: Honor others' positions, skills, commitments, and volunteer efforts; disagree courteously.

## Incident Reporting

If communications lack respect or friendliness:

1. Address it directly with the person if comfortable
2. Contact the project maintainer for unresolved issues

All complaints will be reviewed and handled with discretion and respect for all parties involved.
