  - `utils.py`: 40% â†’ 100%
- **Real DICOM data tests**: Integration tests with actual CSA headers
- **All VR types tested**: IS, DS, FL, FD, SS, US, SL, UL, UN, string types
- **Error handling tests**: Comprehensive edge case and malformed data testing

#### Documentation

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0 Migration Guide

#### No Breaking Changes
Version 1.0.0 maintains full backward compatibility with 0.0.1. All existing code will continue to work without modifications.

#### Recommended Updates

1. **Update Python version**: Minimum is now Python 3.9
   ```bash
   # Verify your Python version
   python --version  # Should be 3.9+
   ```

2. **Update type hints** (if you're using them):
   ```python
   # Old style
   from typing import Union, Optional
   def func(x: Optional[int]) -> Union[str, int]:
       pass

   # New style (Python 3.10+)
   def func(x: int | None) -> str | int:
       pass
   ```

3. **Leverage new examples**:
   ```bash
   # Check out the NiBabel integration example
   python examples/nibabel_integration.py your_dicom.dcm
   ```
